# Overheight-Vehicle-Detection-System
Our objective was that when a vehicle of small height comes out from the bridge, let it go &amp; display a message of `Happy journey` but when a vehicle of height equal to or greater than the height of the bridge comes, then down the barrier and display a message ` Overheight Vehicle Detected , Take Right Turn `.
